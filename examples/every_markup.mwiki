An example of a definition list:

; Term
: Definition of that term.

; Word
: Well, not every word is a “term”. Some are other stuff. 

What follows is a definition list without empty lines between term/def pairs:

; Term 1
: Def 1
; Term 2
: Def 2

This is legal.

== Section ==

I am the initial paragraph and I have all the procedural markup: ''Italic'' is slightly slanted, '''bold''' is drawn with thickerlines, and '''''bold-italic''''' you should not use. [[Links]], however, are very useful and may also point [[elsewhere|Link]]. A paragraph may contain soft line-breaks like this one <br>
which will make me continue here.

I am the second paragraph and I serve as a test for the EOLs token.

There is a horizontal line above me.

=== Subsection ===

* First
* second
* Third

# A
# Be
# Ce

This sermon three parts:
# One
## First subsection of one
## Second Subsection of one
# Two
#* First point
#* Second point
# Three

Amen.

I am the last paragraph and I’m mostly here to round things up.
